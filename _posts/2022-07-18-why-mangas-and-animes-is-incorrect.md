title:  "Why mangas and animes is incorrect"
---

# Introduction
Saying "My favourite animes are..." or "I read a lot of mangas." is incorrect.

# My main points
1. You say: “I like to watch movies in my spare time.” but nobody says: “I watch animes”, everyone uses: “I watch anime”. Same applies for manga, "I read books" but "I read manga".

2. The words “anime” and "manga" originates from Japanese. Japanese doesn't have plurals in the English sense, they are understood by context or by counters.

3. If you search "animes" or "mangas" on Oxford dictionary it doesn't exist.
